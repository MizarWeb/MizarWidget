# MizarWidget Docker image

This is a Debian derived image containing the Mizar client called MizarWidget.

## Building the image

The image can be generated by the following command

	sh ./build.sh

If you use a HTTP proxy to connect to Internet, define the following variable

	export HTTP_PROXY=http://<login>:<pwd>@<host>:<port>

## Usage

MizarWidget can be run by running the following command

	sh ./run.sh

Then, the GUI is accessible on 

	http://localhost:8000 

and the documentation is accessible to 

	http://localhost:8000/api_doc/

The web server's port is mapped on the port `80` on the container to a user specific port on the host. So, if you need to run MizarWidget to a specific sport (other than 8000), please run the following command :

	docker run --name mizar -d -p <host port>:80 mizarweb/mizarwidget

In addition, if you wish to change the default MizarWidget configuration file, you can do it by mounting the volume to your own configuration files

	docker run --name mizar -d -p <host port>:80 -v <my conf directory>:/opt/mizar/conf mizarweb/mizarwidget
  
The log can be accessed by doing

	docker logs <containedID>

## Registry

MizarWidget can also be deployed simply by using the following command

	docker pull mizarweb/mizarwidget
